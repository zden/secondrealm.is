___________________________________________________________________________________________

If you want to experience this demo in Google Chrome run locally you must launch
the browser with the following command: chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files

Other browsers should work fine as demo was tested across various systems and browsers.

WebGL in Safari on OSX is supported after manual enabling of this feature.
Go to Safari preferences, open Advanced tab and check 'Show Develop menu', then
in the browser application menu open 'Develop' and click 'Enable WebGL' option.

Browsers on Android system support WebGL that is more recommended option
instead of canvas version that should work everywhere.

iOS does not support WebGL at all even with alternative browsers.

On mobile devices or outdated PCs without WebGL support always deselect 'Hi-detail' option.
